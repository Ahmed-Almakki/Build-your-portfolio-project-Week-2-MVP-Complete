                                                                                                    ##MAZE PROJECT
#Progress:
	I would rate my progress on a scale of 1 to 10 as a 7. I have a few tasks left to complete before I finish my project, so I believe a 7 is a fair assessment.
 I have successfully completed the initial tasks, and there are approximately 3 or 4 remaining, which I expect to complete in the next two to three days.

#Challenges:
  The most challenging issue I faced was that the walls did not appear in 3D, despite my being confident that I was implementing everything correctly. 
Even though I was certain I was following the right approach, the walls were still being rendered in 2D instead of 3D.
After two days of revisiting my work, I discovered the problem was simply that I had declared a variable as an int instead of double or float.
Although I have resolved the issue, I am still trying to understand why this particular mistake caused the walls to be drawn in 2D rather than 3D.
